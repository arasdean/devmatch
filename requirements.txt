Strip Integration 
* Users should have a customer token (stripe0) ---- 
* Javascript prevent pro form from submitting  ----
and send card info to stripe who will return card token
* JS should send user fields and card token to our rails app for validation. ---- 
Rails app should validate the user fieldsl Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2
* Once validated rails should send user info (email/plan id/card token) --> stripe server
stripe will then create a subscription and send back customer token. 
* rails should save customer token and user information to our db 

** note the difference between customer and CARD token.
